## About Grace Esther Lee (Heasoo)
<br/>I'm a first-year Ph.D. student in the Computer Science department studying machine learning and healthcare at [ERLab](http://er.cs.ucla.edu/), **UCLA**. I am currently supported by the NRT MENTOR Fellowship for the 2020-2021 academic year.
My undergraduate degree was in Public Health from Johns Hopkins University. Afterward, I've worked as a software engineer at Samsung SDS from 2014 to 2017, where I've learned so much from brilliant developers and UX designers. While working at Samsung SDS, I've developed software systems ranging from the Electronic Health Records System to an Android mobile application for diabetic patients. Then I graduated from [Database systems lab](http://dbs.snu.ac.kr/members/gracelee/), **Seoul National University**, with a Master's degree in Computer Science.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm passionate about supporting people to understand and gain insights from structured and unstructured information and implementing the information extraction process into the form of interactive applications people can use. My research interests lie at the intersection of **Human-Computer Interaction** and **Knowledge Extraction**. I hope to design and implement efficient AI systems that provide accurate, fair, and ethical assistance aligned with the **public good** in the **human-in-the-loop approach**.
