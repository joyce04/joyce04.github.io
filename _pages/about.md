## About Grace Esther Lee (Heasoo)
<br/>
I'm a master student studying database and machine learning at [Database systems lab](http://dbs.snu.ac.kr/members/gracelee/) **Seoul National University**. Before coming back to school, I've worked as a software engineer at Samsung SDS from 2014 to 2017, where I've learned so much from brilliant developers and UX designers. While working at Samsung SDS, I've developed software systems ranging from the Electronic Health Records System to an Android mobile application for diabetic patients.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm passionate about supporting people to understand and gain insights from structured and unstructured information and implementing the information extraction process into the form of interactive applications people can use. My research interests lie at the intersection of **Human-Computer Interaction** and **Knowledge Extraction**. I hope to design and implement AI systems that provide accurate, fair, and ethical assistance aligned with the **public good** in the **human-in-the-loop approach**. **Knowledge Extraction** includes building **Knowledge base construction** pipelines from unstructured data, including text and XML data with **machine learning** and **natural language processing**.
