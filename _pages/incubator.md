[Figure 1] Stakeholders of Clinical Trials <br>

**Background**: As Shown in [figure 1], Clinical trials involve many stakeholders from pharmaceutical companies to candidate participants. From an industrial perspective, a new product such as a drug or device can strengthen the companyâ€™s sales. As more advanced technologies get involved in the product development process, different strategies or collaborators are engaged for faster and efficient operation.

Starting from evaluating the change of strategies of different characteristics of companies investing in clinical trials, the project proposes to expand the analysis to concerns of more stakeholders. <br>
